The BikeShare plugin allows users to create Indigo Home Control Server 
devices representing Bike sharing service locations. Individual 
devices contain data such as station location and number of available 
bikes.

Notes: The Bikeshare plugin requires access to the Internet in order 
to work with the bike sharing services that the plugin supports. It 
also requires Internet access in order to check for plugin software 
updates.
