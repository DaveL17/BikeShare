The BikeShare plugin allows users to create Indigo Home Control Server devices representing Bike sharing service 
locations. Individual devices contain data such as station location and number of available bikes.

Notes: The BikeShare plugin requires access to the Internet in order to work with the bike sharing services that the 
plugin supports.
