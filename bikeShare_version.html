Version: 1.1.01
EmailSubject: Bike Share Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Bike Share Indigo Plugin you are using has been updated.

v1.1.01
- Updates to Indigo API 2.0 (Indigo 7 now required).
- Converts testStation device state from string to boolean True/False.
- Refactors 'dataAge' and 'executionTime' device states.
  . 'dataAge' now keyed to the last time the bike dock station communicated
    with the bike sharing service.
  . 'executionTime' now keyed to the last time the Indigo plugin communicated
    with the bike sharing service.
- Removes legacy device state 'renting'. Users should use the state 'isRenting'.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
