        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The BikeShare plugin allows users to create Indigo Home Control Server devices representing Bike sharing service locations. Individual devices contain data such as dock
            location and number of available bikes. <br><br><a href="https://github.com/DaveL17/BikeShare/releases">[ DOWNLOAD ]</a></p>

        <h3>Installation</h3>
            <img class="TextWrap" src="BikeShareConfig.png">
            <p>Installation is easy. Download and extract the Indigo Plugin file onto your Indigo server machine. Double-click the plugin file and follow the prompts. Presently, the
                plugin contains functionality for the following North American bike sharing services:
                <ul>
                <li>Aspen - We Cycle
                <li>Chattanooga - Bike Chattanooga
                <li>Chicago - Divvy Bikes
                <li>Columbus - CoGo Bike Share
                <li>New York - Citi Bike
                <li>San Francisco - Bay Area Bike Share
                <li>Toronto - Bike Share Toronto
                </ul>
            <p>The plugin supports only one service at a time--but a theoretically unlimited number of stations in that service--and the operation of the plugin is very simple.
                <ol>
                <li>Within the plugin preferences, select the bike sharing service that you want to use.
                <li>Create a device for the bike dock you want to track. There is no limit to the number of station/devices you can have. The station names are automatically picked up
                    from the service, so they will always be up to date. I have added a device state called "dataAge" which will give some indication of how current the data are.
                </ol>
            <p>Bike Share is compatible with local bike sharing services that subscribe to a specific, standard data sharing format (see below). These files are standardized across bike
                sharing services and the resulting JSON file always begins with the following code: <br><code>{"executionTime":"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM","stationBeanList":</code>
            </p>
            <p>If you have a bike sharing service that you want added to the plugin, it must make it's data available in the "stationBeanList" format. To have a service added to the
                plugin, just post the url to the <a href="http://forums.indigodomo.com/viewforum.php?f=158">BikeShare forum</a> or send it directly to me via private message from the
                Indigo website. Here's a <a href="http://www.divvybikes.com/stations/json">sample file</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This plugin is useful for things like:
                <ul>
                <li>Triggers: "Alert me when available bikes drops below a threshold."
                <li>Control Pages: adding the number of available bikes.
                </ul>
