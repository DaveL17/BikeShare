<h1>About</h1>
<p>The BikeShare plugin allows users to create Indigo Home Control Server devices representing Bike sharing service locations. Individual devices contain data such as dock
    location and number of available bikes. </p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<img class="TextWrap" src="img/img_BikeShareConfig.png">
<p>Installation is easy. Download and extract the Indigo Plugin file onto your Indigo server machine. Double-click the plugin file and follow the prompts. Presently, the
    plugin contains functionality for the following North American bike sharing services:
<ul>
    <li>Aspen - We Cycle</li>
    <li>Chattanooga - Bike Chattanooga</li>
    <li>Chicago - Divvy Bikes</li>
    <li>Columbus - CoGo Bike Share</li>
    <li>New York - Citi Bike</li>
    <li>San Francisco - Bay Area Bike Share</li>
    <li>Toronto - Bike Share Toronto</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin supports only one service at a time--but a theoretically unlimited number of stations in that service--and the operation of the plugin is very simple.
<ol>
    <li>Within the plugin preferences, select the bike sharing service that you want to use.</li>
    <li>Create a device for the bike dock you want to track. There is no limit to the number of station/devices you can have. The station names are automatically picked up
        from the service, so they will always be up to date. I have added a device state called "dataAge" which will give some indication of how current the data are.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Bike Share is compatible with local bike sharing services that subscribe to a specific, standard data sharing format (see below). These files are standardized across bike
    sharing services and the resulting JSON file always begins with the following code: <br><code>{"executionTime":"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM","stationBeanList":</code>
</p>
<p>If you have a bike sharing service that you want added to the plugin, it must make it's data available in the "stationBeanList" format. To have a service added to the
    plugin, just post the url to the <a href="http://forums.indigodomo.com/viewforum.php?f=158">BikeShare forum</a> or send it directly to me via private message from the
    Indigo website. Here's a <a href="http://www.divvybikes.com/stations/json">sample file</a>.
</p>
<p>This plugin is useful for things like:
<ul>
    <li>Triggers: "Alert me when available bikes drops below a threshold."</li><br>
    <li>Control Pages: adding the number of available bikes.</li>
</ul>
